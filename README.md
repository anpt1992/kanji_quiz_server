# kanji_quiz_server
This project use as backend for my Kanji Quiz mobile app.
To use this project you need to create a file named ".env" in app directory and fill your database config something like this.

#DB
DB_DRIVER="mysql"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_PORT="3306"
DB_DATABASE="kanji_quiz"
DB_USERNAME="root"
DB_PASSWORD=""
DB_CHARSET="utf8"
DB_COLLATION="utf8_unicode_ci"
DB_PREFIX=""

Finally, you need to import database from kanji_quiz.sql at root folder.
Good luck Have fun!
